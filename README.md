## The Coronavirus Tweets Text Mining and Sentiment Prediction
### Background
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019[6].
The relevance of the COVID-19 global pandemic in Mar, 2020 has raised the attention of researchers all
over the world.


Since there wasn’t any proved effective medicine or vaccine back then, CDC initiated a quarantine guideline for COVID-19 prevention. Most of the schooling and work were moved online until now. Social Media
became an essential resources for people to communicate with each other. It certainly made our lives convenient. However, it’s a double-edged sword. Misinformation, fake news and extreme emotion can mislead
the public. In a way, remote work and learning increased the anxiety in public because of the social media.


One of largest online public communities Twitter is an important resource for people to learn about this
new virus and communicate with each other. It’s a very significant to detect the negative sentiment, rumors and misinformation from those tweets to avoid the public anxiety and the topic trending during the
pandemic. This research is meant to be a social behavior study focusing on the Coronavirus Tweets Text
Mining and Sentiment Analysis and will be flexible to be transferred to other social media text datasets

representing and communicating the information with the public.
